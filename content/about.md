Founded in 2017, Technical Theatre Society was started with the aim of providing better collaboration between societies at York, to be a gateway for students who want to get involved in running shows, and a resource for other societies to easily find technicians and hire equipment.

We also give the societies the flexibility to perform in venues that aren't fitted out with permanent lighting and sound equipment, using our stock of portable equipment.
