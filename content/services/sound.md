We have multiple sound desks available for use including our SQ5 which has 48 Input channels and is able to cope with our largest productions. In addition to this we have several sets of microphones including SM58 and SM57 as well as condenser microphones and a set of drum mics. While we donâ€™t own any, we also frequently work with radio mics and would be able to hire these in for you. We also have a line array as well as additional speakers that can be used alongside our mixing desks and microphones. Our members are trained to use all of our mixing desks as well as additional ones that we hire in for larger productions. They are also trained in QLab which allows the use of music, sound effects and pre-recorded tracks in productions. If you have any specific requests for your sound designer please let your project manager know!
